                I met this person recently on a trans/phobe server (don't ask, I don't know either) and we had quite a few similar interests. Some of those interests include 
                Arch Linux, desktop environments, web development (they even have <a href="https://saraistupid.github.io">their own website!</a>), among many other tech type 
                things that most people would probably find extremely boring. One extreme positive about this person is that they are accepting when it comes to ideologies - 
                for one, they're ancap (anarchist-capitalist) and I happen to differ from their own beliefs, yet we're still able to get along very well. Another thing we 
                happen to have in common is being <abbr title="This is likely to change. I'm still questioning my own identity.">MtF transgender</abbr>! [obligatory :3 here] 
                Overall, I've only known this person for about a week or so but we've remained in good contact ever since and grown to bond over small things. I hope the 
                friendship and comradery we have for each other may eventually lead us to working on projects together or even meeting in real life!
