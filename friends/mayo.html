                This silly fucking goober is legitimately the funniest motherfucker on the planet. She spends most of her time playing silly ass rhythm games 
                on Roblox, but she's INCREDIBLY fucking talented. If you saw her gameplay, your little nuts would be quakin' pal. I'm not joking when I say that
                this person will forever be one of my greatest friends. She has a really vibrant and open personality, and despite being treated like shit all her life 
                <i>(fuck you, <strong>God</strong>)</i>, she will never fail to put a smile on your face, even the tiniest grin. Other than rhythm games, she enjoys Dragonball, 
                sushi, and being the cutest fucking being known to mankind. The only thing that could possibly overcome the cuteness of this silly lil bastard is some 
                being that humans have not heard of nor seen. She does not even have to make you try to laugh or enjoy the time you spend with her, she does it naturally like 
                some sort of goddess. I dare you to find one thing wrong with this person. <strong>ONE.</strong> Yeah that's right, you fuckin' can't you beta cucklord. Your 
                feeble little eyes would have to dig fruitlessly for any flaws. She's smart, pretty, and fun to be around. If anyone were to make an acquaintance with her, 
                you'd find it hard to ever let go of such a wonderful being.
