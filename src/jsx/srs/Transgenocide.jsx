        content: <>Referring to a transgender person as "a trans" or slurs removes all personality and reduces their existence to a trait. Being trans is now an insult or a joke. This is seen almost everyday by transphobes who constantly deny the existence or the personal afflictions of a transgender person, and remove them from all humane context to advance their pathetic culture war.</>

While news organizations will not explicitly state their ill intentions or beliefs directly, they will communicate this by censoring or redacting information altogether to avoid playing the notes they shouldn't. One example of how this relates to transgender people is often seen in British media by publications like the BBC or The Guardian. Publishing articles with heavy anti-trans bias is becoming increasingly common in the UK.</>

        content: <>Trans people have been murdered for their identity in the past, and often it is dismissed as a one-off deal.

Trans people like Brianna Ghey, Caelee Love-Light, and Daniel Aston (killed in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorado_Springs_nightclub_shooting">Club Q massacre</a>) are unfortunately examples, as this is notable to the functioning members of society; although, for homophobes like <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/crime/anderson-lee-aldrich-colorado-springs-shooting-b2348450.html">Anderson Aldrich</a>, they <i>choose</i> to keep their eyes shut.</>

        content: <>Since transgender people are part of a larger LGBTQ community, transphobic murders and massacres are extremely likely to extrapolate to gay folk. Due to the fact transgender people are a smaller group than the Jews were before and during Nazi reign, many will look upon this genocide with a blind eye and feel they are seeing nothing because it isn't on such a large scale - yet.</>

        content: <>Transphobes have already been claiming there is no active genocide against trans people, for irrelevant or mundane reasons such as "genocide is defined as the killing of an entire group" or "only (##) transgender people were murdered last year!" This largely misled ideology stems from far-right media propaganda and bigoted indoctrination. The denial of the ongoing genocide against transgender people in the United States is a denial of history; there is no other excuse.</>

The obsession with refusing bodily autonomy are perfectly reflected by the sociopolitical climate as it stands, whereas the evolution of America's economy to fascism is seeing entire demographics isolated and ostracized, just as any other fascist nation has done. There is no reason to have trans people ceaselessly interrogated or, even worse, killed everyday for their identities. It is times like these where the wise words of comedian/realist George Carlin become relevant: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zg9bf2WxTcA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Nazis lost World War II, but fascism won it.</a></p>
