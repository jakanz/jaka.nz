                I honestly don't remember when or where I first met this person. It was sometime during the early months of 2021, possibly on a self-help server I 
                joined due to my declining mental status at the time. When we met each other again on a random casual game on CS:GO two years later in June 2023, 
                we didn't even recognize each other, we just thought we were cool people. We didn't realize that we had earlier messages on Discord until she gave 
                me her Discord username and the screen returned an error saying that we were already friends. I searched my messages list and, sure as shit, we 
                already had messaged each other. This was a genuine shock to us, as we had evidently changed a lot since that singular night that we spent getting to  
                know each other (and eventually forgetting altogether) all that time ago. We had changed in ways we did not expect, including how we behaved and 
                thought. Finally being able to properly meet her on a personal level, she came to be an honestly great person and even better teammate. I hope that in 
                the time we will know each other in the future, we can come to be even better friends, possibly in real life. Here's to an outstanding person and an 
                outstanding personality in my life! She means a lot to have around.
