                    you're likely unfamiliar with who i am or what i do. but i'll do my very best to explain who i am and my hobbies throughout this reading. i'll try not to talk too much about what is likely uninteresting.<br>

                    i'm <b>jakanz</b>, an internet microcelebrity only capable of basic tasks. if you're a hardcore primus or soad fan, you may be familiar with some of the concert footage archives i've put on my <a href="https://youtube.com/@jakanz">youtube channel</a>:

                    if it isn't obvious enough, i have a bit of a relationship between me and internet archivism. i tend to archive old tapes of events like concerts or major tragedies, which includes 9/11. i've made my fair share of relatively important archives of this event, especially of those hard to find anywhere else:

                    <p>
                        other than internet archivism, i also like to speedrun random games and try to get as many world records as much as possible. i wont link them here, but you can view them on my <a href="https://speedrun.com/user/jakanz">speedrun.com page</a>.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        speaking of gaming, i also like to casually play <abbr title="Counter-Strike: Global Offensive&#013;2000+ hours invested">CS:GO</abbr> and <abbr title="3400+ hours invested">minecraft</abbr>, although i sometimes play other games like <abbr title="96 hours invested">tower unite</abbr> and <abbr title="Grand Theft Auto V&#013;240+ hours invested">gtav</abbr>. however, when i'm not doing any of the above hobbies like gaming or archiving, i'm usually working on coding projects, such as the website you're on right now.
