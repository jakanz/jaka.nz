                I don't know this person that much on a personal level, but I can guarantee you that they're one of the best people and one of the most 
                understanding when it comes to strong emotions. In terms of hobbies and interests, it's really hit and miss - some are really general like the internet, 
                while more specific interests may involve <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jkwj1kPZHxQ">historical facts</a> and games like shapez, but 
                otherwise they aren't very mysterious. Their persona is a little skeletal goofball with floating bones as a neck. How does that work, centuryy? 
                Personally, I believe they're an underrated niche internet microcelebrity. Sure, they can't create Nexpo-level content, but that isn't necessary to 
                make things that are *actually informative.* If you can, view some of their social medias below! I think they're pretty neat.
